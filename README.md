For our manuscript **"Pedigree reconstruction and distant pairwise kinship estimation from genome sequence data: A demonstration in a population of rhesus macaques (*Macaca mulatta*)"**, we present here the 47 closely related PRIMUS pedigree structures, reconstructed from whole genome sequence data in 150 rhesus macaques from the Tulane National Primate Research Center, and code used for data analysis.
